	Thank you again for attending this user study about classifications of images based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutchik%27s_Wheel_of_Emotions#Plutchik.27s_wheel_of_emotions" target="_blank">emotions.</a><br>
	You will see 300 images as a grid and select the corresponding emotions for each image from below checkboxes.<br>

<ol style="font-size:20px;">
	Please;<br>
  <br><li>Do not refresh or close the page during the study.</li><br>
  <li>Check at least one checkbox per image to be able to submit the study.</li><br>
  <li>Use Firefox or Chrome web browsers. The study may also work with other browsers but not tested.</li><br>
  <li>Choose what emotion image contains instead of what you feel about an image (<b>i.e.</b> A crying baby may sense funny for you or may make 		you laugh but you should select '<i>Sadness</i>' for the sake of the study.). 
  	<br>An image does not have to phisically show an emotion, you should select the emotion that the image '<i>conveys</i>'. For example, a dark autumn image might symbolize sadness, where a brightful image taken in summer/spring might convey joy.
  </li><br>
  <li>If you can not classify an image into any of 8 emotions then you should select '<i>Neutral</i>'.</li><br>
  <li>Do not leave the study before finishing it successfully.</li>
