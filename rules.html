<h4>
	Hi,<br>
	Thank you for agreeing to participate in this user study. The goal of the study is to identify which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutchik%27s_Wheel_of_Emotions#Plutchik.27s_wheel_of_emotions" target="_blank">emotions</a> are expressed in images. To this end, you will see a collection of 300 images and you will be asked to associate each image with one or more of eight basic emotion categories, by clicking at the corresponding checkboxes.<br><br>
	
	When you finish the study you should click the button saying <i>'Submit your votes'</i>. Then your submission will be validated and your votes saved.<br>

	Note that:<br><br>
  <li>You should not refresh or close the page during the study.</li><br>
  <li>Use Firefox or Chrome web browsers. The study may also work with other browsers but has not been tested.</li><br>
  <li>You should select <u>at least one</u> emotion category per image. If you are uncertain of what option to choose, please select <i>'Neutral'</i>.</li><br>
  <li>For each image, please select the emotion (or emotions) that <u>you feel it expresses</u>. Note that this is not necessarily how the content of the image makes you feel, e.g., a crying baby might make you laugh because you find it funny but you should probably select <i>"Sadness"</i> and/or <i>"Fear"</i> if these emotions are conveyed by the image. Also, an image does not have to physically show an emotion, e.g., a dark autumn image may convey the emotion of <i>"Sadness"</i> whereas a bright image taken in summer/spring may convey the emotion of <i>"Joy"</i>.</li><br>
  <li>Finally, we kindly ask you not to leave your survey incomplete.</li>
